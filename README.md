# Prime-Number
Get Prime Number using Python 
Use the code to get all the "prime numbers" or "unique number" between any specific range. 
- If you call the function UN(2, 2000) it will give you all the prime numbers between 2 to 2000 and to get any prime number you can go as high as you want, for ex. UN(2, 2**999999999999999), this will give you prime number between the given range.
- If you call the function UN(111 to 2000) this will give you all the unique number between 111 to 2000 and again there is no limit to this.
